  bio: `I’m a 3rd B.Tech Computer Science student with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

With hands-on experience in developing AI-powered applications — from chatbots and image-based civic issue detection to NLP-driven tools — I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical, impactful solutions. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and human-centered AI design.

I take a research-driven, implementation-focused approach to problem-solving and constantly explore new technologies and frameworks to enhance my capabilities in the AI/ML domain.

I’m also an active contributor on Kaggle, continuously exploring data-driven challenges and enhancing my skills in Python, deep learning, and model optimization.

Let’s connect — I’m always open to collaborating on innovative projects or exploring new ideas in the AI space.`,
